class: \Drutiny\algm\Audit\HttpHeaderRegexChecker
name: algm:HTTP:Cache-Control
description: |
  Cache-Control header informs reverse proxies and browsers how to cache your
  web page for performance reasons. A cacheable page should also contain the
  max-age directive. E.g. `max-age=600; public`.
remediation: |
  Your site is choosing not to cache this page for some reason. Drupal sites
  in general will cache unless page caching is not enabled or there is an element
  on the page that prevents caching from taking place. We recommend you revise your
  cache settings and elements in use on this page.
success: |
  {{ header }} header found with a {{ regex }} set.
failure: |
  {{ header }} header matching {{ regex }} not found in response.
parameters:
  header:
    default: Cache-Control
  regex:
    default: 'max-age='
